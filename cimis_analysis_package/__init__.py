# cimis_analysis_package/__init__.py

# This file makes Python treat the directory as a package.
# You can leave it empty or use it to expose parts of your package.

# For example, to make some functions directly available like:
# from cimis_analysis_package import some_function_from_data_fetching
# you could add:
# from .data_fetching import fetch_and_save_station_list_from_api
# from .config import TARGET_VARIABLES_CONFIG

# For now, we'll keep it simple.
print("CIMIS Analysis Package initialized.")
